This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Visitor counter

The footer shows the number of unique browsers online and the all-time unique visitor count. Counts are refreshed every 30 seconds; a browser is considered online for 90 seconds after its most recent heartbeat. A first-party, HTTP-only cookie remembers an anonymous random visitor ID for one year, so a browser that clears or expires its cookie may be counted again. No IP addresses are stored.

The counter uses an Upstash Redis database. Create a database and add its REST URL and token to `.env.local`:

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-database.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-rest-token
```

Set the same environment variables in your deployment provider before deploying. Without them, the visitor counts remain unavailable.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
